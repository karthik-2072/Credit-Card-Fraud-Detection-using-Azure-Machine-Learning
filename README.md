#Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust credit card fraud detection system using Azure Machine Learning. By leveraging the power of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and custom pipelines, the project aims to efficiently handle and process data, select optimal models, and deploy a real-time inference system capable of detecting fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

#Azure Setup
Create a Resource Group:

Navigate to the Azure portal home.
Select Resource Groups and create a new resource group.
Create Machine Learning Workspace:

In the resource group, select Machine Learning Workspace and create a new workspace.
Provide necessary details such as workspace name, region, and resource group.
Create Compute Resources:

Under the Manage tab, create a compute instance for development.
Set up a compute cluster for model training by specifying the VM size and the number of nodes.
